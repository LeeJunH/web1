    <h2>WEB이란 무엇일까?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank"><strong>Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</strong></a>
      The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents
      and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/),
      which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.
      [1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
      and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and
      are published by a software application called a web server.
      The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed the Web in some form
      by over two decades and upon whose technologies the Web is built.
      English engineer and computer scientist Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.
      He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.
      [3][4] The browser was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991,
      and then to the general public in August 1991. </p>
